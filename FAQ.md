## STL export does not have components on PCB

this is a [KiCad design issue](https://forum.kicad.info/t/v6-step-3d-model-export-missing-components-or-completely-empty-board-is-exported/33847).
usually opening model in newer KiCad and updating paths solves the issue.

in case KiCad project has been imported from other tool (eg. Eagle CAD), some changes of elements enclosure types might be needed.
